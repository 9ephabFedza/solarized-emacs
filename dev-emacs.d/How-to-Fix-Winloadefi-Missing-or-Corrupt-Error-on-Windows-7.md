## Method 1: Rebuild the BCD
 
The BCD (Boot Configuration Data) is a database that stores information about how to boot Windows. If the BCD is damaged or corrupted, it can cause winload.efi error. To rebuild the BCD, you need to use the command prompt from the Windows installation disc. Here are the steps:
 
1. Insert your Windows installation disc and restart your computer.
2. Choose your language settings, and then click "Next."
3. Click "Repair your computer."
4. Select the operating system that you want to repair, and then click "Next."
5. On the System Recovery Options menu, click "Command Prompt."
6. Type the following commands and press Enter after each one:

    bootrec /fixmbr
    bootrec /fixboot
    bootrec /scanos
    bootrec /rebuildbcd

The last command will scan for Windows installations and prompt you to add them to the BCD. Type Y for yes or A for all and press Enter.
 
Restart your computer and see if the error is resolved.
 
## Method 2: Run chkdsk and sfc
 
Another possible cause of winload.efi error is file system corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive. To check and repair any errors on your disk, you can use the chkdsk (check disk) command. To check and repair any corrupted or missing system files, you can use the sfc (system file checker) command. Here are the steps:

1. Insert your Windows installation disc and restart your computer.
2. Choose your language settings, and then click "Next."
3. Click "Repair your computer."
4. Select the operating system that you want to repair, and then click "Next."
5. On the System Recovery Options menu, click "Command Prompt."
6. Type the following command and press Enter:

    chkdsk C: /f /r

This command will scan and fix any errors on your C drive. You may need to replace C with the letter of your system partition.
 
When chkdsk is done, type the following command and press Enter:

    sfc /scannow /offbootdir=C:\\ /offwindir=C:\\windows

This command will scan and fix any corrupted or missing system files. You may need to replace C with the letter of your system partition.
 
Restart your computer and see if the error is resolved.
